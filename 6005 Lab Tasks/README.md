# 6005-CEM-Codebase


This repo contains code examples for the 6005 CEM module

It will be the stuff we use in the Lab sessions.
As well as Solutions to some of the coding problems.

If you have your own solution, (or a different way of dealing with the problem),
feel free to submit a pull request, and I will add you the the relevant section.
